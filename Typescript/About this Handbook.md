The handbook is split into two sections:

- The Handbook

The Typescript Handbook is intended to be a comprehensive document that explains Typescript to everyday programmers.

You should expect each chapter or page to provide you with a strong understanding of the given concepts.

The Handbook does not fully introduce core Javascript basics like functions, classes and closures.

The Handbook also is not intended to be a replacement for a language specification. In some cases, edge cases or formal descriptions of behavior will be skipped in favor of high-level, easier-to-understand explanations.
