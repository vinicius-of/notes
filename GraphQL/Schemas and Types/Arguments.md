- Every field on a GraphQL object can have zero or more arguments.
- ![[Pasted image 20240126225810.png]]
- All arguments are named.
- Unlike some programming languages, all arguments in GraphQL are passed by name specifically.
- The `length` field has one defined argument, `unit`.
- Arguments can be either required or optional.
- When optional, we can define a default value.
